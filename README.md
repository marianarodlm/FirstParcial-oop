APP PARKING LOT
You have a parking lot that accepts cars only during certain times. Th cars can be charge by minute, hour or days. You will charge different depending on whether the car is a compact, SUV or van. You need to keep track of the available spaces to admit a car. You need to show how many spaces are left. There are different spaces for compact cars, SUV and van.
